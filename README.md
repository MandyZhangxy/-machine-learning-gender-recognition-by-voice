# Gender Recognition by Voice

This is the final project of 6101 Introduction to Data Science in the George Washington University.

the Data is from http://www.primaryobjects.com/2016/06/22/identifying-the-gender-of-a-voice-using-machine-learning/

In this project, the goal is to use classification models to recognize gender by an audio wav file.  

- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest 

## Demo
After selecting the best model among those three according to highest accuracy rate, I recorded the voice  during presentation and do recognition.

For players in demo, you can find your audio in `/data/` folder, and thanks for recording with us.
