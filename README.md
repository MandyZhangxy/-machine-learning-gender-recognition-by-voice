# Gender Recognition by Voice

This is the final project of 6101 Introduction to Data Science in the George Washington University.

the Data is from http://www.primaryobjects.com/2016/06/22/identifying-the-gender-of-a-voice-using-machine-learning/

This is reproducing the process of recognition of gender by human voice. 
In this project, the goal is to use classification models to recognize gender by an audio wav file.  

- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest 

Second, I want to select the best model according to highest accuracy rate.
